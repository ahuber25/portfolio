# Week 2 homework: Create your own portfolio website

The code I created from scratch and loaded to github is up to date with all that I have done so far, such as Run-buddy and the first Horiseon project, though I did not write the code for that and instead simply editted it so that it worked. Unfortunately, I do not have much else that I can share, but I know by the end of this course, I will have far more uploaded to the portfolio, perhaps including this as well.    
The portfolio can be found here if you are not using the README in github: https://github.com/ahuber25/portfolio    
And the page where the code is working is here: https://ahuber25.github.io/portfolio/
